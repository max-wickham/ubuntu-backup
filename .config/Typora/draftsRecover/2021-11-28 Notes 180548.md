## Traffic Equations and Operation Equations

- Open System with $n$ nodes and $C_k$ completions at $1<k<n$ nodes.
- At equilibrium $A = C$, every job arrives exactly once, $A$ arrivals
- Flow balance assumption is that $A = C$ or that $\frac{A}{T} = \frac{C}{T}$, system is unstable if this does not hold in the long term
- The throughput of a system is $X = C/T$
- If the system contains a resource with a total busy time $B$ the *utalisation* of the resource is $U = B/T$
- The average service time of each job is $S = B/C$, the service rate is $\mu = C/B$
- **The utilisation law** : $U = X \times S$, $\frac{B}{T}= \frac{C}{T} \times \frac{B}{C}$
- **Littles Law**
	- $I$ is the number of jobs in the system
	- $N = I/T$ is the average number of jobs in the system
	- $R = I/C$ is the average time each job spends in the system
	- $N = X \times R$

- **Forced Flow Law** 
	- $C_k$ is the number of job completions at resource $k$
	- The average number of visits each job makes to resource $k$ is then $V_k = C_k/C$, $C_k = V_kC$
	-  $X_k = V_k \times X$, $X_k$ is the throughput of resource $X$
- **Response time Law**
	- A closed system consists of $N$ users
	- $Z$ is the average think time, i.e the time between the completion of one request and the submission of the next.
	- $X$ is the request submission rate
	- Average total time for each cycle is $R+Z$
	- $R = \frac{N}{X}- Z$

- **Service Demand Bottleneck Laws**
	- The average service time at resource $k$ is $S_k$
	- The average *service demand* at each job is $D_k=V_kS_k$
	- $D_k = \frac{V_k}{X_k\times}X_kS_k = U_k/X$
	- $U_k \le 1$ so $X<1/D_k$ for all $k$ thus $X_k\le 1/max_kD_k$
	- Under heavy load $U_{max} \approx 1$
	- $1/D_{max}$ is the *Upper asymptotic bound on through put under heavy load*
	- The resource with the highest $D$ is the bottleneck
	- In an open system arrival rate and throughput are the same ($\lambda = X$) which means $\lambda \le 1/D_{max}$
	- Under light load no job has to queue so the average time each job spends at $k$ is just $D_k$ and minimally $R = \sum\limits_{k}D_k$
	- In general we have $X \le min(\frac{1}{D_max}, \frac{N}{D+Z})$, for open systems $Z = 0$ but $N$ isn't fixed
- **Response Time Bounds**
	- Under high load since $X \le 1/D_{max}$, $R = \frac{N}{X} - Z \le ND_{max}-Z$ 
	- Under low load each job experiences the average service demand without queuing i.e $D$, reponse time can't be lower than this so $R \ge D$
	- $R \ge max(D,ND_{max} - Z)$
- **Traffic Equations**
- $a_k$ is the probability an arriving job goes straight to node $k$
- $C_k = Aa_k + \sum_{i=1}^nC_ir_{ik}$
- A job completing at node $i$ goes to node $j$ with probability $r_{ij}$
- Job completing at node $i$ goes to node $j$ with probability $r_{ij}$

- These traffic equations can be used to determine per node visit counts and throughput 
- $\lambda_i$ is the arrival rate for a node, $\lambda(I-R)=\gamma$
- Vector Form
	- $V(I-R) = a$
	- $X(I-R) = \gamma$
### Operation Equations

- $A$: Number of arrivals to a system
- $C$: Number of completions
- $\lambda = A/T$: Arrival rate
- $X = C/T$: Throughput
- *Equilibrium* $\lambda = X, C = A$
- $N$: Number of jobs flowing around a closed system, (can be though of as number of users)
- $B$: The total busy time for a resource
- $U = B/T$: Utilisation of a resource
- $S = B/C$: Average service time of a each job at a resource
- $\mu = 1/S$: Average service rate
- **Utilisation Law**
	- $U = X \times S$
	- Utilisation of a resource is equal to the through put of the system times the average service time of a resource
- **Littles Law**
	- $I$: Integral of $A - C$ in request seconds
	- $N = I/T$: Average number of jobs in the system
	- $R = I/C$: Average time each job spends in the system
	- $N = X/R$
- **Response Time Law**
	- $Z$: Time between completion of one request and submission of the next in a closed system
	- $N$: The total number of users
	- $X$: Request submission rate
	- $R+Z$: Average total time for each cycle
	- $R = N/X-Z$
- **Forced Flow Law**
	- $C_k$: Number of job completions at resource $k$
	- $V_k = C_k/C$: Average number of visits each job makes to resource $k$
