Dear Sir/Madam

I am a third year Electronic and Information Engineering Student at Imperial College London and I am writing to apply for the Software Engineering Internship. 

I have been interested in broadening my knowledge in the field of Machine Learning for the past couple of years, both through courses such as the Coursera "Machine Learning with Python" course and through working on my own projects such as a neural network generation and training program in Python backed by information taken from research papers and lectures. So far I have been fascinated by the types of problems I have been able to solve using this field and am working to improve my knowledge. This year I have to opportunity to learn more about Machine Learning on my university course as I will be taking "Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning" and "Deep Learning" modules.

Since last year I have been working part-time for a small company called Goldex working on a gold training platform. This experience has been especially useful in learning how to work on software as part of small team and manage engineering tasks within a group. My role there has been building micro-services in Java and due to the fact that the services I've been building are handling real world transactions the reliability and test coverage of the code has been extremely important, teaching me how to produce reliable code at a fast pace. Most of the back-end related projects that I have worked on myself have been python based giving me a lot of experience with this language. I made this decision due to Pythons applicability in both web related projects and scientific and numerical projects. 

During this summer I also had the opportunity to work at ARM as a software engineer. My role consisted of writing examples for yet to be released processors in ARM Assembly and C. This allowed be to improve my knowledge of writing extremely low level code and the challenges that accompany it whilst working on projects such as an example hypervisor or a setup sequence for a memory protection unit. 

Recently I have been trying to work on projects that are algorithm driven and performance focused to try and improve my skill in this area. An example of this is an arbitrary precision class that I wrote in C++  that I was then able to use to make an RSA encryption library for python. Part of the reason for projects like this is to get a better understanding of how high performance machine learning and numerical libraries for Python are built, such as Tensor Flow and Sci Kit Learn. 

Whilst working as a software engineer I would like the opportunity to work on technology that can have an impact in many scientific fields and help improve human knowledge whilst also improving peoples quality of life through scientific advancement. I believe that Deep Mind presents the best opportunity to be able to pursue this career as it continues to create cutting edge research such as advancemnts recently in Being able to work at Deep Mind would allow to me learn more so much about this field that has really excited me. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discover what it is possible to achieve using these technologies. Thank you for reading my application and I look forward hearing from you.

Kind Regards,
