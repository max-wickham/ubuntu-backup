## Traffic Equations

- Open System with $n$ nodes and $C_k$ completions at $1<k<n$ nodes.
- At equilibrium $A = C$, every job arrives exactly once
- $C_k = Aa_k + \sum_{i=1}^nC_ir_i,k$
- $a_k$ is the probability an arriving job goes straight to node $k$
- Job completing at node $i$ goes to node $j$ with probability $r_{ij}$

$$
C_k/C = V_k = a_k + \sum_{i=1}^nV_ir_i,k \\
  C_k / T = X_k \\
  V(I-R) = a \\
  X(I-R) = \gamma \\
$$

- These traffic equations can be used to determine per node visit counts and throughput 
- $\lambda_i$ is the arrival rate for a node, $\lambda(I-R)=\gamma$

## Poisson Processes 

$$
X: P(X = n) = \frac{(\lambda t)^n e^{-\lambda t}}{n!}
$$

- Exponential distribution is memory-less, the future is independent of the past
