# Zipline Cover Letter
- You've designed and built electromechanical systems and robots outside the classroom. Previous interns have built submarines, solar cars in the Australian outback, electric boats, rockets, etc.
- You’re comfortable working in C, C++, Python, and/or Rust, and have developed software for a real time operating system or embedded linux.
- You set a high standard for your software -- your code is efficient, easy-to-ready, well-tested, and has friendly APIs. 
- You’re familiar with basic electrical engineering concepts, such as reading schematics, and debugging with a multimeter, scope, and logic analyzer.
- You can work independently--taking ownership of projects with ambiguous requirements--as well as collaboratively with a diverse team.
- Additional interdisciplinary engineering skills are a plus, such as control of dynamic systems, PCB design/CAD, or backend infrastructure experience.
