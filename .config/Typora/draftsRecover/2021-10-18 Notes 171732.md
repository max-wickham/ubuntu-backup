## Graph Theory

- $N$ is the set of Nodes
- $E$ is the set of edges
- $R$ is the incidence relation $R : N \times E \times N$
- A path is a sequence of one or more nodes, [A,B,C], first node in last is last node in path
- "frontier : ", returns the last node in a path
- $P_G = \unio^\infty_{i=0}P_i$
