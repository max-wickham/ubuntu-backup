Dear Sir/Madam

I am a third year Electronic and Information Engineering Student at Imperial College London and I am writing to apply to the position of ****. 

I have been interested in broadening my knowledge in the field of Machine Learning for the past couple of years, both through courses such as the ** and through working on my own projects such as a Neural Network generation and training program in Python backed by knowledge taken from research papers and lectures. **Interest in Deep mind specifically**. **Talk about Courses taking this year**. 

Since last year I have been working part-time for a small company called Goldex working on a gold training platform. This experience has been especially useful in learning how to work on software as part of small team **add something else**. My role there has been building micro-services in Java and due to the fact that the services I've been building are handling real world transactions the reliability and test coverage of the code has been extremely important. 

During this summer I also had the opportunity to work at ARM as a software engineer. My role consisted of writing examples for yet to be released processors in assembly and C. This allowed be to improve my knowledge of writing extremely low level code and the challenges that accompany it whilst working on projects such as an example hypervisor or a a setup sequence for a memory protection unit.
